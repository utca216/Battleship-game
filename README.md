# Battleship-game
My game generates randomly one 3 pints long, two 2 points long and three 1 point long ships. It generates it the way that they will not be adjacent even at the corner.
While plaing player will see 7X7 map where: 0-means that player didn't shoot there, it may be empty or contain a ship or part of it. h-means that player previously shoot to that point and hit the ship. m- mean that player previuosly shoot to that point and there is no ship, miss.
Whole program devided into methods, so it can be more readable.
